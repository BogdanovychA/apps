    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications (hereinafter "Applications") developed and published by the <strong>NGO "Foundation.101"</strong> (hereinafter "we", "us", or "our").</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This policy explains how we handle information in our Applications. Since our Applications are designed to be privacy-friendly, we do not collect personal identification information from our users.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or process any personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address. No registration is required to use our Applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Permissions:</strong> Our Applications do not require access to sensitive device features (e.g., camera, microphone, contacts, gallery, or precise GPS location) unless specifically stated within the app for a functional purpose initiated by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We do not collect technical identifiers such as IP addresses, unique device IDs (IMEI/UDID), or detailed hardware specifications for tracking purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To improve the quality of our services, we use third-party tools that may collect anonymized data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect aggregated, non-identifiable statistical information (e.g., how many users opened the app, which screens are most popular). This helps us understand how our Applications are used and how to improve them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Payments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Ads:</strong> Our Applications do not contain third-party advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>No Payments:</strong> We do not process in-app purchases or collect payment information through our Applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Applications are intended for a general audience. While children may use our apps, we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Our content is appropriate for all ages.</p>

    <h2>6. Regional Restrictions</h2>
    <p>We do not provide our services or support Applications for users located in the russian federation and the republic of belarus.</p>

    <h2>7. Global Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)</h2>
    <p>Although we do not collect personal data, we respect global privacy standards, including the GDPR (EU) and CCPA (USA). Since no personal data is stored, requests for data deletion or portability are generally not applicable.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
